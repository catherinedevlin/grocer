## Original Requirement
[UpDayton](http://updayton.com/) has put together a paper brochure highlighting all grocery stores, farmers markets, ethnic food stores, and CSA's in the Dayton region. This informational piece would best serve the larger population of Dayton, and newcomers to Dayton, by being interactive and digital. It doesn't not include big box stores, but instead small local stores. It also has the bus routes of RTA listed as a data point.

It would look something like an overlay on Google Maps but would show all the data that our team has collected aside from hours of operation and contact information
